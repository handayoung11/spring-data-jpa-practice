# spring-data-jpa-practice
I studied Spring Data JPA hard through [this lecture](https://www.inflearn.com/course/%EC%8A%A4%ED%94%84%EB%A7%81-%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%84%B0-JPA-%EC%8B%A4%EC%A0%84/dashboard).  
And in this repository, I stored codes.  
it is my [notion pages](https://cheddar-limpet-07e.notion.site/JPA-120255f416db4f39a2da8f5817f7e451) for summarizing lectures.
